# Python Console Battleship
A simple implementation of battleship that runs in the Python console. I created this as an academic project.

## Requirements:
Python 3.0 or later must be installed to run this program.

## Features
- The ability to place one ship anywhere on a 5x5 grid.
- An AI that randomly places a ship and guesses your coordinates.
- A visual grid in the console that displays hits and misses each turn

## Planned Features:
- The ability to place multiple ships of varying lengths
