# Python Console Battleship
A simple implementation of battleship that runs in the Python console. I created this as an academic project, but any feedback is welcome.

## Requirements:
Python 3.0 or later must be installed to run this program. You can download the latest version of Python from https://www.python.org/. After you have installed it, download this repository and unzip it. Finally, double click on the Main.py file to play battleship in the Python console.

## How to play:
- Enter the X and Y coordinates where you want to place your ship. These must be between 1 and 5.
- Enter the X and Y coordinates where you want to fire.
- If you or the AI hit a ship, then the winner will be announced and the console will close.

## Features
- The ability to place one ship anywhere on a 5x5 grid.
- An AI that randomly places a ship and guesses your coordinates.
- A visual grid in the console that displays hits and misses each turn

## Planned features:
- Multiple ships of varying lengths
- An option to play local multiplayer
- A customizable difficulty option for the AI
