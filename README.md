# Python Console Battleship
A simple implementation of battleship that runs in the Python console. I created this as an academic project.

## Requirements:
Python 3.0 or later must be installed to run this program.

## Features
- The ability to place one ship anywhere on a 5x5 grid.
- A basic AI that places a ship randomly and guesses at you ship location.
- A visual grid in the console that displays hits and misses every turn

## Planned Features:
- The ability to place multiple ships of varying lengths
